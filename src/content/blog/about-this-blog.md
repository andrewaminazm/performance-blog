I started a blog focused on **performance testing**.

It's for testers and QA who want to run real load and performance tests — without the hype.

You'll find:

→ **Copy-paste prompts** for JMeter, k6, and Postman (API tests, parameters, tokens)  
→ **Short guides** on load vs stress vs spike, metrics, SLAs, and how to analyze results  
→ A **Tools** section with step-by-step setup, scenarios, and AI prompts for each tool

Read it here: [https://glittering-mousse-1be21f.netlify.app/](https://glittering-mousse-1be21f.netlify.app/)

Use the **Tools** link in the nav for full guides and prompts for each tool.

If you are exploring performance testing or choosing between JMeter, k6, and Postman, this might save you some time.
